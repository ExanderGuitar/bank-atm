# Bank ATM

## About
This repository hosts a personal proyect to practise C++. I feel a bit rusty and I want to refresh the languaje.
Also this serves myself to practise git and github flow from the command line.

## Installation
1. Download or clone the project.
2. From terminal execute make.sh
3. The executabuble will be called Bank_ATM

## Use
Everything is written on text format. The users.txt contains the login information and balance. To add new users keep the same format.
That's all. This is just a practice project of an ATM.

## Notes
There is no verification of input format, that is way even the password accept a string.
Sensible information is stored as plain text and it should be encrypted and secured.
It would be nice a dedicated user interface but I don't know yet how to do it.
